## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Credit Card Animation in Browser Window" project aims to provide users with an interactive tool for presenting a credit card in an attractive and user-friendly manner within a web browser window. This animation can be utilized on banking websites, financial platforms, or in e-commerce applications.

### Feature Description:

- **Credit Card Animation:** Users will be able to view a smooth animation of a credit card within the browser window.
- **Interactivity:** Ability for user interaction, such as card movement, color changes, etc.
- **Customization:** Access to tools for customizing the appearance of the card, such as background color, font, icons, etc.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensuring that the animation is responsive and adapted to different screen sizes.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Credit Card Animation:** Users can view a smooth animation of the credit card within the browser window.
- **Interactivity:** Ability for interaction, such as card movement, color changes.
- **Customization:** Access to customization options for the card's appearance.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensuring the animation is responsive across different devices and screen resolutions.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Smooth Animation:** Expectation for the animation to be smooth and free of delays.
- **Aesthetic Appearance:** Ensuring the animation presents itself aesthetically and professionally.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with various web browsers.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of Interface:

- _Credit Card Animation:_ Main window with the animated card.
- _Customization Panel:_ Panel with customization options, such as color changes, fonts, etc.

### Site Map:

- _Credit Card Animation_
  - Main window with animation
  - User interactions
- _Customization Panel_
  - Options for customizing the card's appearance

## System Architecture:

### Description of Data Structure:

The application stores data related to the appearance of the credit card, including:

- **Customization Parameters:** Information about the customization parameters selected by the user.
- **Card Appearance:** Data regarding the card's appearance, such as background color, font, icons, etc.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a simple client-server model, where:

- **Client:** User's web browser, displaying the animation.
- **Server:** Web server hosting the application and handling user interactions.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or other framework for building the interface).
- **Backend:** Optionally, depending on requirements, e.g., Node.js for handling HTTP requests.
- **Animation:** Utilization of animation libraries, such as CSS transitions or JavaScript libraries (e.g., GSAP).
- **Responsiveness:** Media queries and styling adjustments for different devices.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for animation logic, interface, customization.
- _Coding Style_: Application of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Checking the correctness of animation and interactive functions.
- **User Interface Tests:** Ensuring responsiveness of the animation on different devices.
- **Compatibility Tests:** Ensuring the animation works correctly on various web browsers.

### Testing Procedures:

- Development of a set of test cases for each animation function.
- Regular testing on different devices and browsers.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, corrections, deployment on clients' websites.
- **Timelines:** Determination of dates for planned deployment stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establishment of communication channels with clients for issue reporting.
- **Updates:** Regular updates to improve animation functionality and adapt it to changing browser standards.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Division of work into specific tasks (e.g., animation implementation, interactions, testing).
- **Timelines:** Determination of time required for each implementation stage.

## Cost Estimate:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked or team of developers.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential fees for external services, technical support.
